                <h3>Introduction</h3>

                <p>Video games are one of the most popular forms of entertainment in the world. Using proprietary hardware and software, developed by different companies, you can interactively explore various worlds
                    and ideas that have been put onto a screen. The most common theme between all games is that there is some form of interactivity involved, but the genres and experiences between individual games can
